  <p>
    The KiteAI team has been moving at lightning speed. Just a few months ago, during the Ozone phase, 
    the project focused on building foundational infrastructure and testing agent frameworks. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, KiteAI has already scaled towards the Lunar phase, onboarding real-time data partners and 
    enhancing multi-agent collaboration. The growth trajectory has been exponential, with new ecosystems, 
    alliances, and features being added every quarter. 
  </p>
  <p>
    From its early beginnings to where it stands today, KiteAI is redefining how we think about 
    decentralized AI agents and their role in shaping the future of the internet.
